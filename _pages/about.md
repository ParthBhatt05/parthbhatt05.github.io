<p style='text-align: justify;'> It’s estimated that around one billion people globally have a mental disorder. Despite being critical to overall well-being and physical health, diagnoses and furthermore, treatment or support, remain much lower than this estimate. Let me highlight some key statistics presenting the scenario of mental health across the world.</p>

## Every 6th or 7th person experiences from mental disorder

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Prevalence of mental health disorders has not significantly increased per se. However, this does not mean that mental health disorders are any less pressing. Their prevalence remains high, even if they are not increasing significantly. In fact, as we make progress in combating other health aspects, mental health has become increasingly important in overall health burden on relative terms. As a share of total disease burden, mental health disorders are increasing, even if not in absolute terms. </p>

## There are in general five major types of mental disorders

<p style='text-align: justify;'> While <a href = "files/Share_of_Depression_amongst_mental_disorders.html"> Depression </a> is the most common amongst all other mental disorders, <a href="parthbhatt05.github.io/files/Share_of_Anxiety_disorders_amongst_mental_disorders.html"> Anxiety Disorders </a> are most prevalent amongst people. The other three categories are: <a href="parthbhatt05.github.io/files/Share_of_Eating_disorders_amongst_mental_disorders.html"> Eating Disorders</a>, <a href = "files/Share_of_Schizophrenia_amongst_mental_disorders.html"> Schizophrenia</a>, and <a href="parthbhatt05.github.io/files/Share_of_Bipolar_disorder_amongst_mental_disorders.html">Bipolar Disorders</a>. </p>

|Disorder | Share of global population with disorder (2017) [Difference across Countries] |Number of people with the disorder (2017) | Share of males:females with disorder (2017) |
|--------|-------:|:------:|:------:|
Any mental health disorder	|10.70% |	792 million	|9.3% males 11.9% females|
Depression	|3.40% [2-6%]	|264 million|	2.7% males 4.1% females|
Anxiety disorders	|3.80% [2.5-7%]	|284 million	|2.8% males 4.7% females|
Bipolar disorder	|0.60% [0.3-1.2%]|	46 million|	0.55% males 0.65% females|
Eating disorders	|0.20% [0.1-1%]	|16 million	|0.13% males 0.29% females|
Schizophrenia	|0.30% [0.2-0.4%]	|20 million	|0.26% males 0.25% females|

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Collectively, in most of the countries, mental disorders are more common in women than in men. However, this varies significantly by disorder type: Depression, Anxiety, Eating disorders, and Bipolar disorder are more prevalent in women. Although gender differences in Schizophrenia are mixed across countries, it is typically more common in men.</p>

## Death toll due to Mental disorders

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The direct death toll from mental health disorders is typically low, however, mental health disorders are also attributed to significant number of indirect deaths through suicide and self-harm. Suicide deaths are strongly linked - although not always attributed to - mental health disorders.</p>

**[Suicide death rates vs. prevalence of mental & substance use disorders](parthbhatt05.github.io/files/Mental_Disorder_vs_Suicide_Rate.html)**

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for a disease or health condition are calculated as the sum of the Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality in the population and the Years Lost due to Disability (YLD) for people living with the health condition or its consequences.</p>

## Depression

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Currently, Depression, a common psychological disorder, affects about 121 million people worldwide, and WHO has projected Depression to reach second place in the ranking of Disability Adjusted Life Years calculated for all ages, while it currently stands second for ages 15-44. And other mental illnesses as well have collectively been responsible for the bourgeois of the suicide rate, making mental disorder to be the second leading cause of death amongst 15-29 years old.</p>

**[DALY of people suffering from Depression](parthbhatt05.github.io/files/Disability_Adjusted_life_years_of_people_suffering_from_depression.html)**

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Severity of Depressive disorders is a bit varying. The WHO’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) define this set of disorders ranging from mild to moderate to severe. The IHME adopts similar definitions by disaggregating to mild, persistent depression (dysthymia) and major depressive disorder (severe).</p>

All forms of depressive disorder experience some of the following symptoms:

1. lack of concentration and attention
2. lack of self-esteem and self-confidence
3. thoughts of guilt and unworthiness (even in a mild type of episode)
4. pessimism
5. thoughts about sel-harm
6. insomnia / disturbed sleep
7. loss of appetite
